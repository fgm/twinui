# Terminal + Web UI

This project demonstrates one possible way to provide a full-screen terminal UI
built as a traditional web, thus supporting both a rich user interface in a
browser and a limited but still operational interface using full-screen mode in
a terminal, as used when communicating over SSH to a server, VM, or container.
